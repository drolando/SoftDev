I added to the original game a quest system and some new characters and features.

QUEST 1:
    - Speak with the warrior
    - Find him a new sword
        - speak with the beekeper
        - bring back his bees
            - kick the bees to get them follow you
            - run near the beekeper
            - you only need to bring back the 3 bees near the lake
        - speak again with the beekeper
        - take the sword from inside the crate
QUEST 2:
    - Free the wizard
        - use the warrior to kill the bees
        - speak with the wizard
    - Get a spell from the chemist
        - speak to the chemist controlling the wizard
QUEST 3:
    - Reach the shrine in the center of the map
        - Use the wizard's spell to burn the trees
        - When you arrive near the shrine activate it

You must do those stuff in the right sequence and with the right character (eg. speaking with the chemist
with the boy won't get you the spell and you can't kick the bees before talking with the warrior and the 
beekeper)

### AGENTS ###

I added two new playable characters: the warrior and the wizard. At the beginning you can control only the
boy and the girl but during the quests you'll get the control of the other two. 

- Warrior
    For the warrior I created with GIMP two sets of images. At the beginning he's without sword and after
    completing the first quest he gets a sword and a shield. To do this there are different images for
    running and standing with or without weapons. Attacking is possible only after getting the sword so
    for that action there is only one set of images.
- Bees
    There are two groups of images, differentiated by their ID.
    The first three are near the beekeper and can be kicked: this action'll make them following you. If
    they arrive too near to you they'll attack and you'll loose some health. Every time in the
    onInstanceActionFinished handler they check if they are near the beekeper: in this case they stop
    following the hero and start moving randomly near the beeboxes.
    The other four can be attacked by the warrior: after being hit they will fall and lie on the ground.
    All the bees moves randomly inside a small area near their initial position or near the beeboxes.
    When they moves randomly they're very slow but their speed increases when kicked.
- Wizard
    I renamed the hippie_priest as wizard. It's now a playable character and when he cast a spell he
    creates a fireball wich is useful to burn the trees.
- Fireball
    For the fireball I created with GIMP the 8 images (for each orientation) for when it's flying and for
    the explosion. Stand's images are empty so when the fireball is not being used it's invisible.
    This agent has three action, wich are stand, fly and explosion. There are 4 fireballs in the map, so
    it's possible to cast another spell when the first one is not yet finished.
    Sometimes the fly action fails because there are no free path from the current position to the target;
    to fix this problem immediately before the explosion the agent position is set to the target location.
    In this way you can't see the fireball flying there but you'll only see the explosion.
- Crate
    This crate is near the beekeper. At the beginning it's closed and you can only inspect it. When all
    the bees are back near the beeboxes it'll be possible to open it and get the sword and the shield 
    inside.

### CODE ###

I created some new classes to write a more modular code. I tryed to separate the code related to the
agents, the game status and the dialogs.

- Game
    The main purpose of this class is keep the game status. Inside there's a state machine which decide
    accordingly to the current status which are the available actions.
    

    @@@@@@@@ @@@@@@@@ @@@@@@@@ @@@@@@@@ @@@@@@@@ ToDO @@@@@@@@ @@@@@@@@ @@@@@@@@ @@@@@@@@ @@@@@@@@ 

- AgentManager
    This class initialize all agents and keep a reference to them. It contains a list of all the playable
    characters so it's able to toggle the active agent.
    It also contains methods to get all the agents and get the agent corresponding to a specific id.
    There are two methods 'beesAtHome' and 'BeesDead' which check if all the bees are near the beeboxes
    of if they're all dead.
- Agent
    Every agent class inherits from this class. Here are set the properties and methods common to each
    agent like 'say()' and 'health'. Two useful methods are 'getX()' and 'getY()' which returns the
    agent's coordinates.
- Dialog
    This class shows and hides the instancemenu and the status dialog. The instancemenu's buttons are
    choosen by the Game class because they depend on the agent and the game's state. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### GAME ###

- Dialogs
    At the beginning of each quest or when you click on the hint button a popup will appear with the
    current quest's objectives and hints.
- Health bar
    Immediately below the player image in the top-left corner of the screen you can see the health bar.
    This bar changes color accordingly to the health percentage of the current character. The only way to
    loose height is by being attacked by the bees.
- Status label
    Below the player image there is a label PAUSE which appears when the game is paused, which usually
    means that you are speacking with someone or you're reading the quest instructions. Until the end of
    the dialog or the closing of the dialog you cannot move the characters: all your clicks will be
    ignored.
