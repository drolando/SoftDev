# This tool should print each actor followed by its actions
# Actors are located under objects/agent and are described by .xml files
# Running this script should print the following output:
#  bee: attack, fall, fly, get_hit, stand, 
#  tourist_male2: run, stand, talk, walk, 
#  tourist_female1: stand, talk, walk, 
#  chemist: experiment, read, repair, stand, talk, walk,

#  merchant: pray, run, stand, talk, 
#  hippie_priest: attack, cast_spell, fall, get_hit, read, run, stand, talk, walk, 
#  tourist_female2: stand, talk, walk,
#
# The actor id has to be followed by : and each action needs to be separated by 
# commas (the comma at the end of the line is not important)
#
# The tool is invoked with the root directory of the agents as first
# parameter. E.g., ./tools/actors_summary.sh objects/agents

# Put here your code
